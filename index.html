        <p id ="introduction">Hello, I am  and this website was made with CSS and HTML in the class 'Web Design'. I like to code in javascript with node.js, and computer science in general. I am 14 years old at the time of writing, which is february of 2022. I hope to learn more advanced HTML and CSS in this class to make better websites, and from that eventually expand my knowledge into a career. </p>
